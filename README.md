## Using icons

Icons are from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) via the
[fortawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/react-fontawesome) package.

In order to minimize the bundle size, we add each new icon manually in
[`/src/common/fontawesome.ts`](/src/common/fontawesome.ts).

Then we call them in the usual bulma style:

```tsx
<span class="icon">
  <i className="fas fa-code" />
</span>
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
