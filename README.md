# What and why?

This repository contains a demo react app. It is a simple weather app. It
fetches up-to-date weather data from the [weather.gov API](api.weather.gov) and
displays it for the user.

I threw this together because recruiter types often ask me if I'm okay with
react. This app was designed to include many of the key elements one needs to
construct a frontend app (e.g. API calls, interfacing with a UI library, custom
hooks, container/component distinctions) and nothing more.

_This is by no means a well-polished project._ It is just meant to outline how I
approach this sort of thing. See the [issues](/issues) for notes on elements
that could use some work.

## Features/buzzwords in this app

- [x] âŒ¨ Typescript
- [x] ðŸ“˜ Storybook
- [x] ðŸ“ˆ Time series charting
- [x] ðŸ–Œ sass styling
- [x] ðŸš€ (Very, very simple) automated deployment to github pages

# Development

## Getting started

```bash
npm run start # Start development version of the app

npm run storybook # Start storybook
```

## Organization

The most important items are contained in the `src` directory:

```
.github/           # CI workflow(s)
.storybook/        # Storybook configuration files
src/
  common/          # Constants and functions used throughout
  components/      # Display/"dumb" components
  containers/      # Stateful/"Smart" components
  hooks/           # Custom hooks used in project
  services/        # API services (exported as hooks)
  styles/          # Global style definitions and imports
  test/            # Test utilities. Mostly demo data for use in stories right now.
  types/           # Common type definitions
  App.tsx          # Top-level App component
  index.tsx        # Connects app to DOM
  ...
...
```

### Components and containers

I try to keep a pretty strict division between components and containers.

One hard rule concerning dependencies/imports: 

- Components may only import other components. Never containers.
- Containers can import components and other containers.

Ideally a container should have a super-simple render (i.e. one component with props). That isn't true for
a few containers at present but that can be fixed via a refactor.

### Relative imports

Any file in source can be imported directly. For example: 

```tsx
import {APP_NAME} from "common/constants"; // THIS WORKS
// INSTEAD OF
import {APP_NAME} from "../../common/constants"; // Also works but way uglier, etc.
```

## Using icons

Icons are from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) via the
[fortawesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fortawesome/react-fontawesome) package.

In order to minimize the bundle size, we add each new icon manually in
[`/src/common/fontawesome.ts`](/src/common/fontawesome.ts).

Then we call them in the usual bulma style:

```tsx
<span class="icon">
  <i className="fas fa-code" />
</span>
```

## âš  Warnings

- _Do not store secrets in_ `.env`! It is in version control in order to enable
  the `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK` option.
- If you fork this file you will likely want to change `PUBLIC_URL` in `.env` to
  the correct path before deploying.

## Deployment

I'm hosting the app with github pages. It can be deployed via a manual github
action. Just go to the "actions" tab in GUI, select deploy, then select "Run workflow."

I decided to do a manual trigger rather than an automated trigger because I more
often than not may not desire a re-deploy (despite a push to master, etc.).
